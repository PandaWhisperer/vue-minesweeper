# Minesweeper

This is an exercise we give to students of [Le Wagon - Premiere Classe](http://www.lewagon.org),
a 9 week-long bootcamp for entrepreneurs.

You can [play the game](http://sebastien.saunier.me/minesweeper/),
of fork it and enter you own grid parameters :)

It his hosted by GitHub thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
If you would like to know more about it, I wrote an article on
[how to host any front end project for free with GitHub Pages](http://sebastien.saunier.me/blog/2014/04/27/host-any-front-end-project-with-github-pages.html)
